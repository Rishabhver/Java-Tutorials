GIT :    Contains 2 location :   Local repo (IDE , Computer storage) & Remote repository (on git repositiory)


Local Repo: 
1. All the coding is done on eclipse IDE
2. Then code is transfered to stage folder using -> ("git add.")
3. Then code is transfered to local Repo using ->    (git commit -m "reason")

Remote Location :
1. Then we need to push code from local repo to Remote Repo using -> ()


difference between fetch and push
1. pull: Transfer of code from eclipse[Working directory] to remote repository directly. -------------------1
2. fetch: Transfer of code from local repo to remote repo   -------------2


// to 	move code from local repo to working directory[Eclipse] -> merge operation will be formed  ----------------  2

Formula :  [git pull = fetch + merge]

// Checkin = Push;
// CheckOut = Pull;


//  Difference between Git and Git hub
// Git is a command line tool used for tracking code changes, code flow and code sharing.  SCM - source control management
// GitHub is a web-Based git repository hostiung service

*******************************************************************************************************************
Commands: 

1. First install git
2. on Git hub create project
3. Open command prompt
4. change directory to eclipse project [ cd C:\Users\lenovo\eclipse-workspace\practiceGit]
5. "git init"   :   to Initialize git
6. "git remote add origin "URL"   
7. "git add ."   :  add file to git stage
8. "git status"  :  to see the status 
9.  "git config --global user.name "Rishabh"   -> to configure username
10. "git congig --global user.email "rishab4verma@gmail.com"   --> to configure email
11. "git config --list"  : to see configuration list
12. "git commit -m "this is my code"    : to commit code to local repo
13. "git push -u origin master"  -> to push code to master branch og git hub

// Cooncept of SSH key
1. Anyone can pull the code from our repository but no one can push the code into our repository
2. If we want to authorize someone to push code into our git repository then we need to add SSH key into our github

// How to add SSH
1. go -> setting -> SSh and GPS key -> entre user's ssh key

// how to generate SSH key 
1. We can generate SSH key using putty and puttygen
2. Download putty and puttygen from "https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html"
3. from windows open puttygen
4. Select Key SSH-2 RSA and click on generate
5. While key is generating move the cursor randomly beneth the processing bar
6. The key generated is the SSH key. Copy and paste in the github and save.
7. Docs to generate SSH key can be viewed on "https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/getting-started/ssh-keys/generating-an-ssh-key-manually/manually-generating-your-ssh-key-in-windows "


// clone and pulling

 clone: to get the whole project into our local repository for the first  time . We cannot pull the code for the first time
 1. First create a folder 
 2. then copy the location of folder
 3 move to folder location in cmd
 4. Copy the url of project from git hub
 5 in cmd  " git clone Project URL
 
 pull : to take updated code from github to local repository [first time only clone then afterword we can pull]
 
1. git pull origin master
